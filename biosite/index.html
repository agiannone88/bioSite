        Like Maria in the Sound of Music – she would never become a nun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olga was born in Havana in 1925. She and her younger sister were the children of two immigrants from Spain that had settled in Havana as owners of a hardware store along with other properties. As a child of five or six, Olga went to Spain and
        lived there for three years. Eventually, the family returned to Cuba to manage the store directly. It was in here time in a school run by Ursuline Sisters that Olga decided that she wanted to be a cloistered nun. Fate would have other plans
        for her and in early 1942 she meet Jose who would eventually become her husband. In the late summer of 1942 a house fire killed both her parents. She and Jose would wait a few more years to marry in 1944 in a simple ceremony at San Francisco
        de Paula Church in Havana.

      </p>
      <p>
        The early years of their marriage were quiet. They worked and saved enough money to buy her parent’s hardware store in 1947. For many years, they lived in an apartment over the hardware store. Eventually, they would purchase a house for their
        growing family of now eight children. Times would change dramatically in 1959 with Fidel Castro’s revolution. In September 1961, Olga and Jose make the painful decision to send their oldest six children out of Cuba under a secret US
        government program called Pedro Pan. The children are resettled in Nebraska under the care of the Catholic Church. Olga and Jose are not able to join them until April 1963 when they and the two youngest children are finally able to take a
        ship charted by the American Red Cross to Miami. They join their older children in Lincoln.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their life as immigrants in Lincoln, Nebraska is challenging. Finding a home to rent with eight children poses problems. The new language is also a challenge. Eventually Jose finds work in a factory. The factory owner admires his hard work
        and helps Jose finance the purchase of a home. Olga works a series of odd jobs to help out. In 1967, she suffers a miscarriage losing what would have been her ninth child. They decide that she should go to the university and get her diploma.
        For five years, she went to school, worked and raised her family. In 1972, she would graduate with honors from the University of Nebraska Lincoln with a degree in Education. She went on to teach Spanish at Southeast High School in Lincoln for
        15 years until she retired at 65 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today she is over 94 years old and still lives in Lincoln. Over the years she has taught us so much – how to work hard, how to take care of a family, how to pray, how to sing, even how to mourn the loss of loved ones. Her legacy continues in
        her 16 grandchildren, a lot of great grandchildren and even 2 great, great granddaughters!
